/**
 * Warns if Arrays.deepHashCode() is invoked on an array that contains itself
 * as an element.
 *
 * Arrays.deepHashCode() returns a hash code based on the "deep contents" of
 * the specified array; i.e., if an element is an array, deepHashCode() is
 * recursively invoked to get the hash code of that array. As a result,
 * invoking deepHashCode() on an array that contains itself as an element,
 * either directly or indirectly, is unacceptable.
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#deepHashCode%28java.lang.Object[]%29
 *
 * This property tests if an array can reach itself by recursively iterating
 * all the elements. If it reaches, this property warns because the behavior
 * of deepHashCode() is undefined.
